For my python app to run scans like bandit, pip audit and more using custom docker agent, to run in jenkins pipeline during test stage

there are two dockerfiles one with single stage build and one with multi stage build, using multi stage saved just few mbs of space as this is simple agent but for more complex this difference can be huge
